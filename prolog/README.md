Prolog Problems 

This is old code from when I was first learning Prolog. It needs reformatting,
refactoring, etc.

Problems were oriinally sourced from 
https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems,
but that now seems to be dead. I found a copy at
https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/,
so I have saved a copy of that in [p99.html](p99.html).
