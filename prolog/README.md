Prolog Problems 

This is old code from when I was first learning Prolog. It needs reformatting,
refactoring, etc.

Problems were originally sourced from
https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems, but that now seems to
be dead. I found a copy at
https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/, so
I have saved a copy of that in [p99.html](p99.html).

I found another copy of the problems with solutions at
https://kalabovi.org/pitel:flp:99pl. I like this version but have only just
discovered it and have not yet tried to do anything with it.
