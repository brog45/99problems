# 99problems

I'm putting multiple language versions of the same problems in one repo, because I think it would be interesting to compare them.

## Scheme
[99 Scheme Problems](http://community.schemewiki.org/?ninety-nine-scheme-problems)

I'm using Racket and DrRacket.

## Prolog
[Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems)

I used SWI-Prolog.

These are currently mixed into in another repo. I plan to move them here.
